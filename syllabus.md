## Syllabus

Welcome to data science! This course is designed to build foundational data science skills, including basic data visualization, data wrangling, descriptive modeling techniques, and simulation-based inference. There is no presupposition of prior programming experience; if you have never used Python (or any programming language), this course will (hopefully!) be a gentle on-ramp to programming in Python, geared toward data scientists.

### Schedule

Below is a tentative schedule of topics with the chapters from our __free__ online textbooks ([Inferential Thinking](https://inferentialthinking.com), [Learning Data Science](https://learningds.org/), and [Modern Data Science with R](https://mdsr-book.github.io/mdsr3e/)). 

Students are expected to complete each reading _before_ class (the homepage will provide a link to the exact chapters/subchapters for each class). Topics are subject to be slightly adjusted to match the pace of the class in the first few weeks, but I will give ample warning before doing so!

### Grading breakdown

Your final grade will be determined out of 100% as follows:

Attendance/participation |                                | 10%
Homework                 | weekly, due on Friday evenings | 30%
Exam 1                   | Tue, Sep 23 in class           | 10%
Exam 2 (Midterm)         | Thu, Oct 23 in class           | 15%
Exam 3                   | Thu, Nov 20 in class           | 10%
Exam 4 (Final)           | Fri, Dec 19 10:30am-12:30pm    | 25%

__Attendance/Participation:__ When calculating the attendance/participation grade, I will consider (1) attendance in class, (2) participation in class, and (3) participation in Ed discussions. Attendance in >90% of our classes (= 26/28 of our class sessions) will result in an automatic 100% for this category. If you miss more classes than that, I will consider in-person participation and participation in the Ed forum (both asking questions and answering classmate questions) as well (i.e. it is possible to miss more than 2 classes and still get full attendance if you participate in-person and/or on Ed). Please see the attendance policy below for extenuating circumstances (illness, emergencies, university-sponsored activities).

__Homework:__ Homework is typically a combination of conceptual questions and coding exercises in Python. They will be released on Ed on Friday 3pm and due the next Saturday at 11:59pm. Your lowest homework score will be dropped.

__Exams:__ The exams are closed-book, closed-note paper exams with no collaboration or device usage allowed. Exams may be scaled depending on class performance (only in a way that would increase your grade, never to decrease it). Exam 1 and Exam 3 are smaller and will only include content from the last few topics after the previous exam (i.e. they are not "cumulative"). Exam 2 (a.k.a. the midterm) is a cumulative exam in that it includes topics from Exam 1 and after Exam 1. Same with Exam 4 (a.k.a. the final) - it will include topics from the entire course.

Final letter grades will approximately correspond to:

A = 100-90%, B=89-80%, C = 79-70%, D = 69-60%, F = 59% and below

I reserve the right to change this grading scale based on the performance of the class, but will only do so in a way that increases your final letter grade.

### Course policies

#### Attendance

I know that you have other important demands on your time and that no class is the center of your world, so I aim to be flexible in the attendance policy even though it is a relatively large chunk of the grade. Missed classes will not be counted against you (as a part of the 28 class sessions mentioned in the above [grading breakdown](#grading-breakdown)) if you are absent due to an extenuating circumstance (i.e., illness, university-sponsored athletics/activities, political caucuses and voting, and emergencies).

Unless your absence is unexpected (i.e. an emergency), please do your best to be in touch with me beforehand. Whenever you miss class, you are responsible for checking with a classmate, reading the textbook, and consulting resources to make up missed material.

__First-day attendance:__ Because we have students on the waitlist, I plan to exercise my responsibility to drop anyone who does not attend class on the first day, Thursday 9/4. If you have some extenuating circumstances you should be in touch with me ASAP.

#### Late policy

You each have a total pool of 72 late hours of grace period for homework assignments. When submitting work late, you should submit it on Ed as usual. This will provide a record of your total accumulated late hours for each assignment.

* You do not need to check with me before using your late hours.

* You are responsible for keeping track of your remaining hours throughout the term.

* If you have trouble submitting your assignment online, you should email it immediately.

* Additional extensions for extenuating circumstances (e.g. prolonged illness or emergency) may be granted after you have used your full bank of late hours. In these cases, please contact your professor as soon as is feasible in the current circumstances.

* Accommodations made through the Disability Resources will guide late work policies for those who have specific documented needs. See below for more info.

Once you have used up all of your late hours, I will not accept additional late assignments. Please note that Ed may still allow you to submit, but if you have used all 72 hours, it will not be graded.

#### Plagiarism and collaboration

The homework in the course will best serve you if you make an honest effort by yourself before asking for help. After making your own honest effort, I encourage you to collaborate with other students, but please write your own solution. This means no copy-and-pasting; if I were to ask you about how you came to a solution for each question, you should be able to tell me (1) what you found difficult about the question and (2) how you were able to resolve this difficulty, and who helped you. What made it finally click? 

To that end, I disallow the usage of LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, Gemini, etc.) or other means of attaining solutions without thinking or interacting with humans (e.g. Chegg). If it is grossly obvious that you have used an LLM to generate a solution for you, I may pursue disciplinary action through the Dean's Office. See St. Thomas's full [academic integrity policy](https://www.stthomas.edu/about/departments/general-counsel/policy-pdfs/undergraduate-student-academic-integrity-policy.pdf#_ga=2.24866298.1307296101.1610338739-1268650868.1555465084).

### Stress and support

Your well-being is more important than this class and more important than your grades. It is my hope that this class allows you to prioritize maintaining a healthy lifestyle (i.e. eating well, avoiding drugs and alcohol, taking enough time to relax and reflect, and endeavoring to live your values) before schoolwork. Of course, none of that is easy when we face circumstances out of our control, and especially if we face them alone. So, I hope this class can be a small part of your community, and I encourage you to exchange contact information with your classmates. Also, please let me know (early!) if you are struggling. St. Thomas also has myriad resources (below).

#### Health and Counseling
{: .no_toc }

The [Center for Well-Being](http://stthomas.edu/center-for-well-being/index.html) is a free and confidential resource available to undergraduate students. If a personal or medical concern is adversely affecting your academic performance, please follow the link above to find Health Services, Counseling and Psychological Services, and Wellness Coaching.

Please be aware, however, that this office does not provide “doctor’s notes.” Upon request, they can help you print a log of your visits there, which you can provide as evidence should extenuating circumstances affect your attendance or your ability to meet deadlines.

#### Bias Reporting
{: .no_toc }

St. Thomas is committed to providing an inclusive living, learning and working environment that supports the well-being of each member and respects the dignity of each person. Incidents of hate and bias are inconsistent with the St. Thomas mission and convictions and have no place here. If you are a student who has experienced or witnessed a bias or hate incident, we want to address the incident and provide you with resources. Go to the [Bias or Hate Reporting website]() to get more information and to make an online report. Students can also report in person to the Dean of Students Office (room 241, Anderson Student Center) or to Public Safety.

#### Sexual Harassment and Title IX Reporting
{: .no_toc }

The University of St. Thomas mission and convictions embody our commitment to promote and protect the personal dignity and well-being of every member of the St. Thomas community. Sexual harassment, sexual assault and other forms of sexual misconduct are antithetical to the commitment, and they constitute unlawful sex discrimination. All forms of sexual misconduct are prohibited by St. Thomas. If you have experienced sexual harassment/assault/misconduct based upon gender/sex/sexual orientation, and you share this with a faculty member, the faculty member must notify the Title IX Coordinator, Danielle Hermanny, who will discuss options with you. She can be reached at dhermanny@stthomas.edu or (651) 962-6882. For more information, please go to the [St Thomas Title IX website]().

#### Financial Hardship
{: .no_toc }

Food and housing insecurity is a hidden, yet common, issue among college students. If you have difficulty affording groceries or accessing sufficient food to eat every day, or if you lack a safe and stable place to live, and if you believe this may affect your performance in this course, you are urged to contact the Dean of Students Office for support (2x6050 or deanstudents@stthomas.edu). You may also access food assistance through the [Tommie Shelf Food Mobile](https://www.stthomas.edu/center-for-common-good/volunteer-opportunities/foodjusticetommieshelf/). If you feel comfortable doing so, please notify me so that I may connect you to other resources: [https://www.stthomas.edu/deanofstudents/foodinsecurity/](https://www.stthomas.edu/deanofstudents/foodinsecurity/).

#### Disability Statement
{: .no_toc }

Academic accommodations will be provided for qualified students with documented disabilities including but not limited to mental health diagnoses, learning disabilities, Attention Deficit Disorder, Autism, chronic medical conditions, visual, mobility, and hearing disabilities. Students are invited to contact the Disability Resources office about accommodations early in the semester. Appointments can be made by calling 651- 962-6315 or in person in Murray Herrick, room 110. For further information, you can locate the Disability Resources office on the web at [https://www.stthomas.edu/student-life/resources/disability/](https://www.stthomas.edu/student-life/resources/disability/).
