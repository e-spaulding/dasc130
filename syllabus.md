### Course description

Welcome to data science! This course is designed to build foundational data science skills, including basic data visualization, data wrangling, descriptive modeling techniques, and simulation-based inference. There is no presupposition of prior programming experience; if you have never used Python (or any programming language), this course will (hopefully!) be a gentle on-ramp to programming in Python, geared toward data scientists.

There are some math prerequisites: Math placement at level of MATH 108 or above; or completion of MATH 006, 100, 101, 103, 104, 105, 108, 111, or 113.

### Learning objectives

- Hold a conversation with a professional data scientist using lingo of the field.

- Analyze and visualize data to glean information from the raw numbers.

- Wrangle messy data into a workable format using Python.

- Consider real-world implications of the output from your data science techniques.

### Schedule

Below is a tentative schedule of topics with the chapters from our __free__ online textbooks ([Inferential Thinking](https://inferentialthinking.com), [Learning Data Science](https://learningds.org/), and [Modern Data Science with R](https://mdsr-book.github.io/mdsr3e/)). 

Students are expected to complete each reading _before_ class (the homepage will provide a link to the exact chapters/subchapters for each class). Topics are subject to be slightly adjusted to match the pace of the class in the first few weeks, but I will give ample warning before doing so!

### Course policies

#### Attendance

#### Late policy

#### Plagiarism and collaboration

The __homework__ in the course will best serve you if you make an honest effort by yourself before asking for help. After making your own honest effort, I encourage you to collaborate with other students, but please write your own solution. This means no copy-and-pasting; if I were to ask you about how you came to a solution for each question, you should be able to tell me (1) what you found difficult about the question and (2) how you were able to resolve this difficulty, and who helped you. What made it finally click? 

To that end, I disallow and strongly discourage, for your personal, intellectual, and professional development, the usage of LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, Gemini, etc.) or other means of attaining solutions without thinking or interacting with humans (e.g. Chegg). If it is grossly obvious that you have used an LLM to generate a solution for you, I may pursue disciplinary action through the Dean's Office. I understand the allure of LLMs, and I feel it in my own work too. But I ask you to avoid them for this class for the sake of learning.

The __exams__ in the course are straightforwardly purely your own work. Unless otherwise stated, they are closed-note paper exams and no collaboration or device usage is allowed.

See St. Thomas's full [academic integrity policy](https://www.stthomas.edu/about/departments/general-counsel/policy-pdfs/undergraduate-student-academic-integrity-policy.pdf#_ga=2.24866298.1307296101.1610338739-1268650868.1555465084).

#### Zoom etiquette

I am not planning on holding any classes over Zoom, but sometimes life happens (I get sick and am contagious, family emergency out of state, etc.). In the event that I hold a class over Zoom, I ask the following: (1) Mute yourself when not speaking. (2) If you have a question or comment, feel free to either interrupt me by speaking, or leave questions in the chat. (3) If you think you can, feel free to answer other students' questions in the chat too. (4) Please turn off your video if you're doing something else (and I hope you're not!). (5) On that note, it's nice to have at least a handful of student videos on while I teach, but I won't require it. If you don't want to turn on your video for whatever reason, you can make it easier for me by either (a) turning it on temporarily when you speak, or at the beginning of the call or (b) sending a greeting in the chat at the beginning of the call or saying hi out loud before the period starts to communicate your presence. Not a requirement, just something nice you can do for me and others on the call.

### Grading breakdown

### Stress and support

Your well-being is more important than this class and more important than your grades. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle by eating well, avoiding drugs and alcohol, taking enough time to relax and reflect, and endeavoring to live your values will enable you to feel satisfied with your work at school. However, I recognize this is easier said than done, _especially_ if you feel alone. I hope this class can be a small part of your community, and I encourage you to exchange contact information with your classmates. Also, please let me know (early!) if you are struggling. St. Thomas also has myriad resources (below).

#### Health and Counseling 
The [Center for Well-Being](http://stthomas.edu/center-for-well-being/index.html) is a free and confidential resource available to undergraduate students. If a personal or medical concern is adversely affecting your academic performance, please follow the link above to find Health Services, Counseling and Psychological Services, and Wellness Coaching.

Please be aware, however, that this office does not provide “doctor’s notes.” Upon request, they can help you print a log of your visits there, which you can provide as evidence should extenuating circumstances affect your attendance or your ability to meet deadlines.

#### Bias Reporting

St. Thomas is committed to providing an inclusive living, learning and working environment that supports the well-being of each member and respects the dignity of each person. Incidents of hate and bias are inconsistent with the St. Thomas mission and convictions and have no place here. If you are a student who has experienced or witnessed a bias or hate incident, we want to address the incident and provide you with resources. Go to the [Bias or Hate Reporting website]() to get more information and to make an online report. Students can also report in person to the Dean of Students Office (room 241, Anderson Student Center) or to Public Safety.

#### Sexual Harassment and Title IX Reporting

The University of St. Thomas mission and convictions embody our commitment to promote and protect the personal dignity and well-being of every member of the St. Thomas community. Sexual harassment, sexual assault and other forms of sexual misconduct are antithetical to the commitment, and they constitute unlawful sex discrimination. All forms of sexual misconduct are prohibited by St. Thomas. If you have experienced sexual harassment/assault/misconduct based upon gender/sex/sexual orientation, and you share this with a faculty member, the faculty member must notify the Title IX Coordinator, Danielle Hermanny, who will discuss options with you. She can be reached at dhermanny@stthomas.edu or (651) 962-6882. For more information, please go to the [St Thomas Title IX website]().

#### Financial Hardship

Food and housing insecurity is a hidden, yet common, issue among college students. If you have difficulty affording groceries or accessing sufficient food to eat every day, or if you lack a safe and stable place to live, and if you believe this may affect your performance in this course, you are urged to contact the Dean of Students Office for support (2x6050 or deanstudents@stthomas.edu). You may also access food assistance through the [Tommie Shelf Food Mobile](https://www.stthomas.edu/center-for-common-good/volunteer-opportunities/foodjusticetommieshelf/). If you feel comfortable doing so, please notify me so that I may connect you to other resources: [https://www.stthomas.edu/deanofstudents/foodinsecurity/](https://www.stthomas.edu/deanofstudents/foodinsecurity/).

#### Disability Statement

Academic accommodations will be provided for qualified students with documented disabilities including but not limited to mental health diagnoses, learning disabilities, Attention Deficit Disorder, Autism, chronic medical conditions, visual, mobility, and hearing disabilities. Students are invited to contact the Disability Resources office about accommodations early in the semester. Appointments can be made by calling 651- 962-6315 or in person in Murray Herrick, room 110. For further information, you can locate the Disability Resources office on the web at [https://www.stthomas.edu/student-life/resources/disability/].
