## Course Acknowledgements

Much of the course content for this DASC130 this semester comes from UC Berkeley's [Data 8](https://data8.org) course, which they have made open source for data science instructors and learnersâ€”we also use their free online textbooks [Computational and Inferential Thinking: The Foundations of Data Science](https://inferentialthinking.com/chapters/intro.html) (by Ani Adhikari, John DeNero, and David Wagner) and [Learning Data Science](https://learningds.org/) (by Sam Lau, Joey Gonzalez, and Deb Nolan). We use yet one more free online textbook for our ethics module, which is [Modern Data Science with R](https://mdsr-book.github.io/mdsr3e/) by Benjamin S. Baumer, Daniel T. Kaplan, and Nicholas J. Horton. Thank you!

Additionally, parts of the syllabus and some course materials were adapted from Prof. Jasper Weinburd's Fall 2024 version of DASC130 at St. Thomas, taught in R.
